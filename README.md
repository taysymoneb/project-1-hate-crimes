For our group project, we decided to analyze various facets of a dataset from the FBI on hate crimes committed in the US between 1991-2020. We questioned and analyzed multiple components of the data, including the location of the incidents, the time frame, such as by months and years, the demographic of the offenders and victims, and what types of offenses were committed and how. There were 300,026 total victims of hate crimes between 1991-2020. The race of 96,520 offenders was unknown, and 9,546 were labeled unspecified. 

Taylor's Research Questions & Analysis:

1.What race group committed the most racially motivated hate crimes?

The offender race deemed as "White" committed the most overall racial bias hate crimes. The bias description of "Anti-Black" 
was the most common offensive type for white, Asian, and multiple-race offenders. The bias description of "Anti-White" was the most common offense type for native, islander, and black offenders.

2.What victim type experienced the most racially motivated hate crimes per region(midwest, west, south, northeast)? Is there any relationship between region and race based crimes?

Victims who were black experienced the most racially motivated hate crimes across all regions. The values for each victim type are consistent and don't vary much throughout the four visualized regions. Therefore, it can be theorized that region has little to do with whether or not certain race groups will have a lesser chance of experiencing racial discrimination.

3.What are the trends for hate crime incident reportings in the US and NC from 2016-2022?

Between 2016 and 2022, there has been a definite increase in hate crime occurrences both nationally and locally in North Carolina. However, the number of incidents reported in North Carolina decreased by 15% from 2018 to 2019. After that, there was a drastic 65% increase in hate crimes reported. Nationally, there was a 9% increase in hate crime incidents from 2018 to 2019, followed by a 26% increase between 2019 and 2020.

Stacy's Research Question & Analysis:

4.What is the concentrated time/date of Hate Crime reports? How does North Carolina numbers per month compare to the national numbers?  

I chose this question because I thought it would be interesting to see if thereâ€™s a time of the year when a hate crime is most likely to occur. This was a very large data set with over 240,000 rows and 28 columns. The first thing I did was narrow down the dataset to seven columns I found most relevant to my question. I further cleaned it up by narrowing down the number of crimes by month, both nationally and just for North Carolina. In analyzing the data, it shows September was the month that most of the crimes occurred, with October in second by 22 crimes, followed by May. The data for North Carolina seemed to resemble the national numbers with September having the most incidents, followed by July with 7 less crimes and October in the third spot. It was interesting to see September was the top month because according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics most crimes occur in the summer months. Also keep in mind that there are hate crimes that go unreported to the authorities.

Bryan's Research Questions & Analysis:

5.Do most Hate crimes occur in Cities or Rural areas? 

Cities had higher numbers of Hate crime occurrences compared to Rural areas. With  California being the state with the highest number of Hate crimes followed by New Jersey and New York which have one of the largest cities in the US.

6.Where did most of these Hate Crime related incidents occur?

The objective behind investigating the locations of Hate crimes is to uncover some crucial aspects such as identifying the states where most of these crimes are prevalent and the types of locations most victims were targeted whether that be in urban or rural districts then breaking that down to exactly where. These insights where this data was extracted from is from the FBI crime data explorer focusing specifically on Hate crimes. The dataset was refined and filtered to isolate key information pertaining to the locations and victim counts. 

What was found was that these Hate crimes were mostly concentrated in urban/cities, which aligned due to population density. What this analysis also shows or proves is that the states with highest counts of hate crime victims are home to some of the largest cities in the United States.However, one thing that was noted from this analysis is that most of these incidents occurred more within residences or homes than on the street or sidewalks. Which equals to a little over 105,000 victims and 67,000 victims respectively. This discovery challenges our ideas or assumptions that despite that these incidents occur in larger areas like cities but have higher percentages of it taking place within our homes.
